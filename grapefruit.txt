The Washington Post reports,
AMERICANS ARE FALLING OUT OF LOVE WITH GRAPEFRUIT—
as if we weren’t aware and ashamed.

It all happened so quickly.
Grapefruit leaned close and cooed
desperate words like “tangy”
and desperate stories too 
about how we used to clutch our fruit with two full hands,
about how the aftertaste predicted the afterlife,
about the sweet treats of our primate ancestors
and their grapefruit-sized brains.

Each night Grapefruit calls, and I say all the right lies:
Lipitor for my cholesterol,
orange juice and the pastoral,
the Great Freeze of ’03,
oral herpes.

The Post quoted Joseph, a Florida grapefruit farmer,
and at least he’s honest:
it’s not a convenient fruit.
